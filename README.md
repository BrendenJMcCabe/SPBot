# SPBot
Server Point Bot: Lets users create profiles under the bot so that they can accrew points by simply being in non-afk voice channels and spend those points on various point redemptions like muting/deafening other users for a minute along with some more "honor-bound" redemptions like having someone do 10 push-ups - not feasible to directly implement in to the bot. 
Inspired by Twitch channel points
